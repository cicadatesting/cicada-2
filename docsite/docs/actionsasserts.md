Tests in Cicada are composed of Actions and Asserts. Each test cycle proceeds as follows:

1. Run each action in the actions list
2. Run each assert in the asserts list
3. If there are remaining asserts, repeat the cycle without the ones that have
passed until all have passed or a timeout is reached

> This cycle can be tweaked to better suit your needs. See the [API](test.md) for more details

## Actions

Actions are used to make something happen to a service in situations where we
don't necessarily care about the result.

Suppose we wanted to create 100 Jeff's:

```yaml
description: Actions example
tests:
  - name: add-jeff
    description: Creates 100 Jeffs
    runner: rest-runner
    actions:
      - type: POST
        executionsPerCycle: 100
        params:
          url: "http://api:8080/members"
          body:
            name: Jeff
```

Each action call made to a `rest-runner` will return the following body:

```python
{
  "status_code": 200,
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Content-Length": "33"
  },
  "body": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "jeff"
  },
  "text": "{\n  \"id\": 1, \n  \"name\": \"jeff\"\n}\n",
  "runtime": 19.056
}
```

A list of result for each execution will get stored in the state container at
`state['add-jeff-100']['POST0']['results']`

### Outputs

Outputs are used for storing additional data for an action.

Let's say we wanted to determine the average runtime per action execution:

```yaml
description: Actions example with outputs
tests:
  - name: add-jeff-100
    description: Creates 100 Jeffs
    runner: rest-runner
    actions:
      - type: POST
        executionsPerCycle: 100
        params:
          url: "http://api:8080/members"
          body:
            name: Jeff
        outputs:
        # Used to add state outside of runners 
        - name: average-runtime
          template: >
            {% set runtimes = [] %}
            {% for result in results %}
              {% do runtimes.append(result['runtime']) %}
            {% end %}
            value: {{ runtimes|sum / runtimes|count }}
```

This will add an output named `average-runtime` under `state['add-jeff-100']['actions']['POST0']['outputs']`

> Notice that the template uses a special variable called `results`. This refers
> to the results generated by the current action, since it isn't added to the
> state container until after the action finishes

## Asserts

Asserts are essentially actions where the runner will check the results

This example makes sure that 100 Jeff's were added to the database:

```yaml
description: Asserts example
tests:
  - name: check-100-jeffs
    description: Checks that 100 Jeffs were created
    dependencies:
      - add-jeff-100
    runner: sql-runner
    assert:
      - type: EqualsRows
        params:
          method: SQLQuery
          actionParams:
            query: "select count(*) as cnt from members where name='jeff'"
          expected:
            rows:
              - cnt: 100
```

### Assert Result

The runner will return a message of this format and store it under `state['check-100-jeffs']['asserts']['EqualsRows0']`:

```python
{
    "passed': True,
    "description": "passed",
    "expected": 100,
    "actual": 100
}
```
